International travel may not be possible right now, but the good news is that you can still set foot outside Hong Kong with a seacation on Genting HK’s Dream Cruises! The Genting Dream Super Seacation (setting sail until 31 October 2021) is one of its latest offerings, during which you can enjoy all sorts of entertainment, including an indoor arcade, cinema, a glowing bowling alley, and even a giant outdoor water slide. There are also themed events onboard, including a Japanese Festival, the Oktoberfest, and other seasonal activities all year round. Find out more aboutDream Cruises(星夢郵輪). Disneyland is more than just Mickey and Minnie Mouse! Head over to the Adventureland, the tropical forest zone on the southern side of the Park. Go on a thrilling expedition aboard the Jungle River Cruise, though do be warned that you may get splashed by playful animals along the way. If you’re looking for something a little less wild, visit the Liki Tikis totem poles. In this mini oasis, you’ll be able to cool down as the poles spray mist and water on unsuspecting passers-by. In addition, you can go paddle-boating at Inspiration Lake Recreation Centre, which lies around one kilometre outside of the Park. Take in the scenery of the surrounding mountains, the shimmering manmade lake, and the dynamic fountain.
